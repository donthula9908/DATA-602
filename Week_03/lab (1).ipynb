Unsupervised learning is used for tasks like clustering and anomaly detection whereas supervised learning is used for activities like classification and regression. Applications for these methods include audio and picture recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems. Unsupervised learning may identify hidden structures in the data without any prior understanding of what the outputs should be, whereas supervised learning requires labeled data to train the algorithm. The decision of which strategy to utilize in machine learning relies on the nature of the issue and the data at hand. Both approaches are necessary."],"metadata":{"id":"kPwkLj0zQMKY"},"id":"kPwkLj0zQMKY"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Differences between classification and regression?"],"metadata":{"id":"vrOaQRqkSZSv"},"id":"vrOaQRqkSZSv"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Regression and classification are two examples of supervised learning problems. Regression is used to forecast a numerical value, whereas classification is used to predict the class label of fresh input data. Regression models predict a numerical output value based on the input data, whereas classification models learn to distinguish between several classes depending on the input attributes. The type of output variable being predicted is the major distinction between the two. Regression predicts a continuous variable, whereas classification predicts a categorical variable. The type of output variable that has to be predicted and the nature of the problem will determine whether classification or regression should be used."],"metadata":{"id":"-nS22m8kRTh4"},"id":"-nS22m8kRTh4"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Classification and regression are the only types of supervised learning?"],"metadata":{"id":"9fYvcbwUSgrL"},"id":"9fYvcbwUSgrL"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["No, there are other types of supervised learning besides classification and regression.
